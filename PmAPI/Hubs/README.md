# 🚀 Welcome to the PmAPI Repository! 🚀

This repository is home to some exciting real-time communication features for project management applications. Let's dive in and explore the key files that make this possible. 🕵️‍♀️

## 🎟️ TicketsHub.cs 🎟️

This file is a SignalR Hub in the PmAPI namespace. It's the heart of our real-time ticket and link updates, keeping all connected clients in the loop. 🔄

### 📚 Functions/Methods 📚

1. **SendTicketUpdate(string message)**: This async method sends a ticket update to all connected clients. The update is sent as a string message. 📨
2. **SendLinkUpdate(string message)**: This async method sends a link update to all connected clients. The update is sent as a string message. 🔗

### 🧩 Dependencies 🧩

This file leans on the Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR library. 

### 🎬 Usage Examples 🎬

To use the SendTicketUpdate method, you would call it like this:
```csharp
await SendTicketUpdate("Ticket has been updated");
```
To use the SendLinkUpdate method, you would call it like this:
```csharp
await SendLinkUpdate("Link has been updated");
```

### 📝 Notes 📝

- The methods in this file are asynchronous, meaning they return a Task that represents the ongoing operation. This allows for non-blocking I/O operations. 🚦
- The "Clients.All.SendAsync" method is used to send updates to all connected clients. This is a feature of SignalR Hubs. 📡
- The string messages sent by the methods can be customized to provide more specific updates. 📝

## 🏗️ ProjectsHub.cs 🏗️

This file is all about handling real-time communication in a project management application. It uses SignalR to send project updates to all connected clients. 📣

### 📚 Functions/Methods 📚

- **SendProjectUpdate(string message)**: This is an async method that sends a project update to all connected clients. The update is sent as a string message. 📨

### 🧩 Dependencies 🧩

- System
- System.Collections.Generic
- System.Linq
- System.Threading.Tasks
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR
- PmAPI.Data

### 🎬 Usage Examples 🎬

To use the SendProjectUpdate method, you would call it with a string message like so:
```csharp
await SendProjectUpdate("Project X has been updated.");
```
This would then send the message "Project X has been updated." to all connected clients.

### 📝 Notes 📝

- This file is part of the PmAPI.Hubs namespace, indicating it's likely part of a larger project management application. 🏢
- The SendProjectUpdate method uses the "ReceiveProjectUpdate" event, which clients should be set up to listen for. 🎧
- There are no TODOs or special remarks in the file. 📌

That's all folks! Enjoy exploring the repository and happy coding! 🎉👩‍💻👨‍💻
